u need to have a place for them to get and put work...I use trello and/or slack...split projects into small pieces and demand they finish 1 thing before moving to the next

make sure they give you status updates every day or more

and be clear about what you want....if u don't know what u want and u are just looking for deisgn ideas then tell them to provide 3 to 5 concepts based on a few examples or bulletpoints you provide

you MUST give direction

make sense?

clearly define your expectations

=================

sure, its easy to get good work when they are happy and think everything is noec, but don't take shit from them....imam copy/paste a conversation I had yesterday lol...
